### Meeting summary


* Reviewed the difference between DNC, Neural SLAM, Neural Map.		
* PPT: [N/A]()
* Note: [N/A]()

* Questions
  * Is this showing neural slam being better than A3C-Ext? How is it better? 
  * Why does the memory write head have greater variance than the AC3-ext write head? 
  * Why does columns C and G have different colour schemes (e.g. black background or white background, does this indicate anything?
