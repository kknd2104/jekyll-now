### Paper reviewed
- Paper Title: Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory  

### Meeting summary


* Reviewed all operations and their meaning.		
* PPT: [here]()
* Operation sequence from a code ananysis
	* (Code link)[https://github.com/ixaxaar/pytorch-dnc]. In pytorch, easy to understand, works well.
	* Write
		* Find similar contents "c"
		* Address generation w = gw(ga*a+(1-ga)c)
			* See which memory cell is free 
			* Delete or not ""
			* Important "" (decending order)
			* Usage vector "pi"
			* Allocated adress "a"
		* Reset 
		* Memory writing "M"
		* Link update "L"
		* Precedence update "p"
	* Read
		* Find similar contents "c"
		* Address generation
			* Similar contents
			* Forward
			* Backward
		* Read
		
* Helpful block diagram
